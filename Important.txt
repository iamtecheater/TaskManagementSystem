# I enjoyed building this Task Management System which was a good challenge

# I have taken knowledge that I have and applied it to this web application I have built which took me 3.5 days to build.
# I didn't have much trouble building this application as it was off the backbone of a ToDoList application I built.
# I have not done any Unit testing as it is something I am still grasping but I do understand how to debug and problem solve.
# All my knowledge comes from the Microsoft Learning Wesbite and courses I have obtained via Udemy.
# It was a fun project as it tested my skills. 
# IMPORTANT!!!
# If application gives SQLServer Error then please do as follows:
# Delete Migration folder in the application
# Go to Tools > Nuget Package Manager > Packahe Manager Console
# In Package Manager Console type - add-migration <AddDatabaseName> then type update-database
# F5 to run application

# Go to Manage Departments and create a new Department eg Workshop
# Go to Employee Management and create an employee
